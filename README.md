# lstmNet
LSTM network to predict unsteady flow structures.

# step-1:
In the "example" folder, run one of the ode examples. It generates the dataset and corresponding para.txt (including design parameters) in the "data" folder.

# step-2:
In the "code" folder, model.py executes training and prediction.

# step-3:
In the "results" folder, the trained model and its corresponding files are stored.
